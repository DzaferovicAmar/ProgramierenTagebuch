= Inh.02 -- Pets & Fleas

We are keeping cats & dogs as pets.
Sometimes those are infested by fleas, who bite them.

=== Pet

* Every animal kept as a pet is... a pet
* Each pet has a unique id
** This is assigned upon creation
** The next id is the previous +1
* A pet can be bitten at most 100 times (then it is out of blood ðŸ§›)

=== Cat

* A cat is a pet
* It can climb on trees
** It cannot climb two trees at the same time
* And it can climb down from a tree
** If it was up on a tree
* It represents itself as `I'm a cat`

=== Dog

* A dog is a pet
* It can go on the hunt for animals
** Between hunts, it has to rest for at least one minute
* It represents itself as `I'm a dog`

=== Flea

* A flea is _not_ a pet
* It can jump on pets and bite them
* It can switch to other pets or even none
* It represents itself as `I'm a flea`

== Tasks

. Implement the necessary classes and logic to fulfill the requirements
** Extensive unit tests have been provided to guide you
*** Make sure to use the correct names for classes, methods and properties to ensure that those will work with your implementation
** Mind the class diagram and specification above
. Create full XMLDoc for your code
. Ensure that the provided `Program` produces the following output

.Sample Run

WARNING: Unit tests & `Program` logic are commented to ensure the solution compiles -- enable them as needed while your implementation extends
